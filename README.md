# Annals of Eratomis

This is a game I (Alex Ristich) am working on in my spare time. The game will be a simple RPG in which a player can battle against villains in a battle arena and earn gold to upgrade their equipment.

The goal of this project is to build a game available on multiple platforms (web, iOS and Android) using Meteor+React to develop a better understanding of the ins and outs of web and mobile applications.
